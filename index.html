    <h3 style="color:darkblue">Romeo and Juliet</h3>
    <strong><p style="color:lightslategrey">ACT 1</p></strong>
    <p><strong style="color:lightslategrey">PROLOGUE</strong></p>
    <p>Two households, both alike  in dignity,
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
        From ancident grudge break to new munity,
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows 
         Do with their children's end, noughtcould remove, 
         Is now the two hour's traffic of our stage;
         The which if you with patient ears attend, 
         What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
         <p><strong>SCENE I. VERONA. A public place.</strong></p>
         <p><h6><em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</em></h6></p>
